String handeling is a big part of getting ideal queries. here are some functions to handle Strings.
Concatention:
+ and CONCAT
ex:
SELECT 'abc' + 'bcd' AS test, CONCAT('abc','bcd') AS test2

get range of char you like.
SUBSTRING, LEFT, RIGHT

cases convertion:
LOWER, UPPER

spaces handling:
LTRIM, RTRIM

size:
LEN

CHARINDEX
index of first occurance of substring
ex:
select CHARINDEX('bcd', 'abcdefgbcd'), CHARINDEX('bcd', 'abcdefgbcd',3)

PARTINDEX
similar to charindex, but it return the position of first occrance that match the pattern.

ex:
SELECT  patindex('%[0-3]%', 'ABC942asdf')


REPLACE:
replace all matched substring 1 by substring 2.
use to calculate the number of occurance of substring1:

ex:
find the number of a of person.person's last name.
use AdventureWorks2016;
go
SELECT lastName, LEN(lastName) - LEN(REPLACE(lastname, 'a', '')) as aoccur 
FROM Person.Person

REPLICATE 
replicates a string a requested number of times
useful for formatting
use AdventureWorks2016;
go
SELECT BusinessEntityID, RIGHT(REPLICATE('0',9) + CAST(BusinessEntityID as varchar(10)),10) as formattedid
FROM Person.Person


STUFF:
similar to replace, but specific start position index and length.
SELECT STUFF('abcdefg', 3, 2,'testtest')

Like:
[^char or range] means not in the char list or range
use ! as escape character.
