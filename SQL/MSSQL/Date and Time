When working with time, there is 5 things you may keep in mind.
default date, default time, accuracy of data type, Offset(time zone), language
If you don't specify date, it's 19000101
If you don't specify time, it's 00:00:00:000
accuracy differ from data type.
language is better to dis play with example:
  SET LANGUAGE British;
  Select CAST('06/11/2018' AS DATETIME);

  SET LANGUAGE us_english;
  Select CAST('06/11/2018' AS DATETIME);
  
If you have index on datetimme, don't modify the column becasue it will ignore the index. 
For example, if you want something from year 2018, it's better to say between 20180101 and 20181231 than year(2018)

CAST, CONVERT PARSE
SET LANGUAGE British;
Select CAST('06/11/2018' AS DATETIME);

SET LANGUAGE us_english;
Select CAST('06/11/2018' AS DATETIME);

SELECT CONVERT(DATETIME, '06/11/2018', 101);
SELECT CONVERT(DATETIME, '06/11/2018', 103);

SELECT PARSE('06/11/2018' AS DATETIME USING 'en-US');
SELECT PARSE('06/11/2018' AS DATETIME USING 'en-GB');


#Get Current Date
SELECT
GETDATE() AS [GETDATE],
CURRENT_TIMESTAMP AS [CURRENT_TIMESTAMP],
GETUTCDATE() AS [GETUTCDATE],
SYSDATETIME() AS [SYSDATETIME],
SYSUTCDATETIME() AS [SYSUTCDATETIME],
SYSDATETIMEOFFSET() AS [SYSDATETIMEOFFSET];


#change to timezone
SELECT SWITCHOFFSET(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, '-05:00')
