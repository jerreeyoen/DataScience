Hi all,    
  Since I am seeking another job at this point. I would like to spend my time to summary my understanding and some tricks on creating high performance DDL on MSSQL.   
  The Version I used are SQL server 2012, some companies adopted 2016 and some still using 2008. But there is not much difference. In 2016 they have some cool feature called in column index, and integrated with R. However, since I don't have experience on it. I will stick on SQL server 2012.   
  The target audience are those writing SQL for less than 5 years or not use excution plan to optimize their SQL scripts. well I have less than 5 years experience, but I feel I am better than many SQL developer with "5+ year experience"   
  I plan on discuss the fundamental of MS SQL and I will discuss on joins, CTE, stored procedures, sets, pivoting, windowing, some DML, locks, isolation, deadlocks, batch parsing, conditional procedure, cursors, temp tables, dynamic SQL, triggers, error handling,... maybe more not in my head yet.
